# React JS Framework

What is it?
Who is using it and what problems it solves?
Components and re-usability
Virtual DOM (explained later)

# React First impression

A component snippet of code
Explain JSX and why

only components no...
controllers
directives
templates
global event listeners
models
no view models

just reusuable and testable components

# React Data flow

FLUX architecture explain tree hirerarchical data flow with state and props

state != props props are immutable by the component

events flow up data flow down

# Virtual DOM

Pure javascript representation of the actual DOM in-memory. render is called
when we have changes and React decides when to update the Real DOM.

# Component lifecycle

to interact with the dom

# Styling in the age of React

Traditional methodologies still exist

*BEM
*OOCSS and SMACSS
*CSS Processors

React Based Approaches

*Inline Styles
*Available Libraries: Radium, React Style, JSS, React Inline, CSS modules

Still early for best practices. 
Many choices -> handy toolbox

*Community Comparison:
React VS Angular 2 VS Ember

*Speed performance comparison:
React VS Angular 2 VS Knockout

*React VS Angular1&2: features

# Why going with React

Puts all the javascript mess into a clean and non dictating context
easy to debug and separate concerns with components
Virtual DOM is FAST
Ideal for backend engineers to "touch" a frontend
works great for teams, strongly enforcing UI and workflow patterns
numerous libraries and ready made components out there
we have already developed some inhouse (react-material-forms, react-sketch etc.)

# Why Should EXUS add React in its toolset
*Added value - powerful message to the IT market
*Builds efficient and super fast UIs. Fit for project oriented companies where scalability and maintenance are important
*React native can be used for smaller mobile projects

#Good-to-know issues
*React is merely a UI library
*Module versioning requires attention
*HTML debugging can be difficult



# Future with react?

Facebook will continue to invest in both react and react-native (for the mobile world)
